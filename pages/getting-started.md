## Getting started

Synergy doesn't require any special toolchain,
compiler, plugins etc. Its a tiny (~4k) package
that gives you everything you need to start
building directly in the browser.

The quickest way to get started is to import the
Synergy package directly from a CDN.

### Unpkg CDN

```html
<script type="module">
  import synergy from 'https://unpkg.com/synergy@1.5.0';
</script>
```

You can also install directly into your project
using NPM.

### NPM

```bash
$ npm i synergy
```
